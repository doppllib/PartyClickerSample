# PartyClickerSample

This is a functional sample app built using the Doppl framework. The accompanying blogpost can be found [here](https://medium.com/@kpgalligan/f62ba341719a).

## Android Architecture Components

This is a sample running the new Android Architecture components Room DB. It's based off the first
alpha, without tests, so you probably shouldn't use this. Read about it [here](https://medium.com/doppl/androids-room-db-on-ios-f844e2350817)

## Instructions

Follow the detailed tutorial on our website.

## Branches

The main branch uses a database library that we traditionally used internally at touchlab. Other branches with different db libraries include:

* GreenDAO
* GreenDAO with SQLCipher and encryption
* SQLDelight
* Room DB (this is just a demo. Room is still in alpha)
