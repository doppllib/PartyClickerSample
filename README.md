# PartyClickerSample

This is a functional sample app built using the Doppl framework. It is not a serious app example,
but does demonstrate the basic process of sharing code without too much setup required.

Please follow the [Doppl tutorial](http://doppl.co/docs/Tutorial) to install and run.

## Packages Used

This sample uses Room DB and Rxjava to build a basic sample app. The code below the UI is shared to iOS, and used there as well.
